<description>Hi Jess,  I wasn't proposing universal health care only to the big three but everyone.  Naturally, taxes would go up but everyone would have good health care.  My daughter is in France with universal health care and loves it.  Her taxes pay for her family's care.   America is one of the few first world countries without universal health care.  Sure, we can cure the most exotic of diseases but how about making sure that those who are not blessed with a job that includes health benefits don't have to be constantly looking over their shoulder at the prospect of getting sick.</description>

<description>Tom,
Regarding your query as to my reaction to Universal Health Care and the impact on American automakers, I think I "read into" your question an advocacy for Universal Health Care.
  
As such, I'd note that the "transplants" (Toyota, Honda, Nissan, BMW etc) provide Health Care to their American employees and are not suffering as the Big 3 are. 

Sure, all employers would love to have Universal Coverage.  Seemingly, it unburdens them of this onerous cost of providing Health Care.  But, the "gains" would be short lived. As the noted humorist, P.J. O'Rourke has opined, "If you think your medical costs are high now, wait til they are 'free" "!

So, from my observation, the difference is the Big 3 "gave away the store" in the past (before the "transplants" came to our shore) to the UAW in the form of high wages (not justified by productivity) and benefits and are now a paying the price for their lack of courage in keeping costs in line. 

In the past, they assumed they could pass on the higher costs to the consumer - and they DID until the transplants appeared and gave Americans better cars at lower prices (competition).

Providing for Universal Health to the Big 3 would simply be another "bailout" to poor/incompetent management. and would entail the tax payers picking up the costs when, as demonstrated by the "transplants", this is NOT necessary!

<description>Zimbabwee is a mess and entirely caused by a dramatic change in government and the absconding of family farms that were in families for centuries.  However, poverty only spurs increases in population.  Though HIV/AIDS, malaria, dystentery and other diseases plague middle and southern Africa, their populations continue to grow and are predicted to exhibit the fastest growth rates in 21st century.  HIV/AIDS is an unusual disease in that the incubation period is so long that an infected person may pass on the infection before he/she knows he/she is infected.  Incubations periods vary from a few months to a few years.  Full blown AIDS, though subject to treatment is invariably fatal.  However, the interval between infection and death may be decades.  Consequently, the population continues to climb during the epidemic.  In comparison, the black plague killed about 85% of its victims in less than a week. 

The wealthiest nations have mostly been able to curtail their growth...in some cases they have been too successful and have actually exhibited negative growth.  Unfortunately, the message gets out only/mostly to the countries that have a well-educated public and an open government.  Nevertheless, the wealthy countries simply cannot police the world but simply educate and hope that some of it sticks.  Thanks for the comments.</description>

<description>Tom - Your blog "Economy By A Citizen" covers so many issues that to respond to all would be voluminous to say the least.  I will focus on one of your points to see what areas of agreement we may have and that is the one of the Big 3 Automotives in Detroit.

I totally agree that the foreign transplants (Toyota, Honda, BMW etc) are "eating the lunch" of Detroit.  

Previously, I have written an editorial to the HS concerning my beliefs of what is wrong and what needs to be done.

Quickly, what's been wrong:
a) Poor/incompetent management
b) Rapacious labor contracts
c) Brain-dead Boards of Directors

The "transplants" have been making money making cars in the USA. so there is a "model" for the Big 3 to compare with.  This is known as "benchmarking".

Key among the differences between the transplants and the Big 3 is the absence of Labor Unions at the transplants.  The transplants pay great wages and pay great benefits.  Just look at the lines that form when they are hiring!

The Union Contracts call for "full costs" of over $70.00/hr versus over $40.00/hr at the transplants.  Admittedly, the recent crisis in Detroit has brought the UAW back to the table to reduce this gap; but, a gap still exists.

Additionally, the UAW Labor Contracts call for working rulesthat limit the flexibility of management to get the work done on the factory floor.  Rather than bucking management, the workers at the transplants actually assist the company in finding new ways to be more profitable!

Big 3 Management has proven to be incompetent at managing business in the States.  Interestingly, GM and Ford actually are profitable outside the US.  Hmm, what are the differences?

Lastly, board members should be sued in Class Action Suits for dereliction of their fiduciary duties in letting Management get into the dire straits in which they find themselves.

My Solution? - Bankruptcy!!  By declaring bankruptcy, the Big 3 can wipe out the onerous union contracts.
Management and the Unions fight this action for all the wrong reasons.  A pox on their houses!  The Government can provide Debtor in Possession (DIP) financing while the companies get "cleaned up".  The DIP financing will provide liquidity to the suppliers and not cause the oft-mentioned "domino effect" of bankruptcies for the supplier base.  Further, purchasers of new cars would know their warranties would be upheld.  

Once the "cleanup" has occured, investors would flock to the businesses with this fresh capital paying back to the Government whatever DIP funds that have been used while restructuring

Further, a total house cleaning of the top management. After all, when results are good these people are well paid/rewarded.  The opposite has to occur when they have gone so consistently WRONG!

Lastly, the Boards need to be swept clean.  Replacements would be business people that have actually shown expertise in turning around troubled businesses.  The new stockholders would relish these "new brooms".

What do you think of my recipe?</description>

<description>Tom,
I am a recent reader of your blog - specifically the one concerning overpopulation.  Being the educated man that you are, you are familiar with Malthusian Prophesies so I won't belabor the fact that "overcrowding"  is a bogeyman that has been with us for several centuries.  
An interesting statistic for your consideration.  The area of Duval County, Florida is about 918 square miles (admittedly, some of this is water but for the moment, let's consider all the area to be solid ground).  By giving a person a place to stand in Duval County measuring about 2ft x 2ft (4 square feet), one could accommodate about 7 million people per square mile or, continuing this calculation, about 6.4 billion people totally.  
So, almost all the people in the World could be fit into one county in Florida.  Wouldn't you love the concession stands for that crowd?!
So-o-o, are we really THAT overcrowded?  
Further, those areas where the "problems" exist have forms of government that negatively affect the welfare of their people.  North Korea and Zimbabwe come to mind.  As you know, Zimbabwe used to have a surplus of food and exported same to its neighbors.  When a "different" form of government took over, the place went downhill.
Further, the people of South Korea are thriving while people just north of them are starving. Hmm!  
Where there is poverty, there seem to be governments that work counterproductively to the benefit of the people (translate as non-capitalistic).  What does your analysis show?</description>

<description>Geez Doc,  I tried reading this over and over and I kept getting sidetracked on the, -um, I believe the title of your entry was, "Losing Weight." 

But when I got to the alcohol part, well, that's quite a dissertation -5000 words on the history of alcohol. But what really put this over the top of useless information was the caloric content of ejaculate(?).

C'mon Doc, remember -clean, clear, concise. Stick to the subject and you'll have more readers.</description>

<description>Hi John,  From my vantage point and...admittedly a little nervous, it appeared to me to be full.  Of course, I believe I only said it was the largest audience I had spoken to...and it was at the time.</description>
