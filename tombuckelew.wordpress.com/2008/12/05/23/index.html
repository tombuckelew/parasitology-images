Posted on <span class="postdate">December 5, 2008</span> by tombuckelew 				</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="snap_preview"><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">I am not an economist.<span>  </span>However, I am college educated, and have earned a Ph. D., and enjoyed more than 40 years of college teaching in the biological sciences.<span>  </span>I realize that there has been predatory lending amongst our financial institutions and that those recipients of the loans are somewhat at fault. Their fault is that they did not understand the stipulations that the banks had established.<span>  </span>Basically, they did not understand the fine print.<span>  </span>Who does? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The lending institutions realizing their own fault have sold that “bad paper” to higher-up institutions, literally passing bad loans on to others.<span>  </span>Those receiver institutions in turn have only sold the loans to institutions still higher in the food chain.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">All of us have been subject to chain mail, whether it is intended to gain the mailer money, prayers or freedom from guilt (for not breaking the chain).<span>  </span>This is no different.<span>  </span>The only people who gain (monetarily…can’t provide details on the prayer issue…nor can anyone else) are almost singularly at the first level of the chain.<span>  </span>By the time, the chain has run its course; the number of losers is infinitesimal.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">The big losers in this financial catastrophe are the huge companies who are ultimately left “holding the bag”.<span>  </span>However, the U. S. government has seen it desirable to bail out those companies despite the fact they are willing participants in a monumental<span>  </span>scheme (the term originates from its first perpetrator but most people recognize it as a Pyramid Scheme).<span>  </span>Any individual participating in such a scheme is usually prosecutable according to various state laws such as Missouri’s 407.400-407.420. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Our government has not only NOT prosecuted this practice but now is bailing out the losers at the bottom of the pyramid.<span>  </span>However, someone must lose in this pyramid scheme…and the loser…the US populace.<span>  </span>Well, not exactly.<span>  </span>I should have said the tax-payer populace, since the fat-cats have already gotten their monetary portion of the Ponzi/pyramid scheme before the dupes at the bottom of the pyramid have figured out that they have been had. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Those hapless individuals who began the process by innocently applying to become part of the American dream by owning their own homes are the real losers.<span>  </span>They are the low-to middle income wage earners whose only real guilt is that of being under-educated in financial matters; guilty of being gullible when they were told they were eligible for loans they didn’t think they could afford.<span>  </span>Many paid into the system until the interest rates rose to a point that made them realize the inevitable…that they had been had.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Those individuals are the losers.<span>  </span>They paid into a system that was inevitably going to eat them alive.<span>  </span>Now eaten, they have become the losers.<span>  </span>However, the top of the pyramid (predatory lenders) has made its money and those recipients of that “bad paper” passed along to the bottom feeders of the Ponzi scheme have now been forgiven by the government. Who is going to rescue all those home owners whose mortgages have fallen into default?<span>  </span>Who is going to re-pay the lost equity as a consequence those predatory mortgages?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">The government has in effect “socialized” the lending institutions.<span>  </span>We have heard time and time again about the evils of Socialism.<span>  </span>Yet, we have socialized local governments, socialized the airline industry, now socialized the banking industry.<span>  </span>Why not extend socialism to medicine?<span>  </span>Why not even…socialize the oil industry? Imagine not having to give the oil industry CEOs hundreds of millions of dollars per year…as bonuses. Imagine affordable gasoline at the pump.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Individuals have lost their homes, cars, credit and even jobs.<span>  </span>The predatory lenders have lost nothing.<span>  </span>The stooges who bought their predatory loans should have lost big…but our government has bailed them out.<span>  </span>The big losers are the homeowners who have defaulted on their mortgages but it is nothing compared to what America has lost.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">I drive through my home town and see “for sale” signs on virtually every block.<span>  </span>I know of people who are making mortgage payments on houses that will never be worth what they are paying for them.<span>  </span>I see homes boarded up that could be made livable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Now, we are seeing our “big three” automakers on the verge of bankruptcy.<span>  </span>Whether the government bails them out or allows them to file for bankruptcy remains to be seen.<span>  </span>However, neither is the solution to the problem.<span>  </span>American automobiles have been eaten for lunch by the Asian makers.<span>  </span>I was always a Chevrolet or Ford owner until I bought my first Honda.<span>  </span>It was the best car I had until I more recently bought a Toyota Prius.<span>  </span>My wife and I love the Prius for its comfort as well as its economy.<span>  </span>Until, American automakers re-capture the confidence of Americans, they will continue to struggle.<span>  </span>The Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in due out in late 2009 is a good start.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">The individual and the country were in excellent economic health in 2000.<span>  </span>We enjoyed a budgetary surplus for the first time in my lifetime.<span>  </span>America stood alone as the sole economic and military superpower in the world.<span>  </span>(Apparently we still maintain our role as the economic superpower since the actions of the past couple of months has had serious ramifications on the other world economies…e.g. Russia’s stock market has lost 50% of its value since May 2008 and during the late September crisis actually shut down for two days). China is beginning to see a turndown and subsequent civil unrest.<span>  </span>Our role as military superpower has seriously been affected by the misguided Iraq War. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">The HIV/AIDS pandemic would greatly benefit from the development of a vaccine.<span>  </span>However, until the early 2000s, the US government had still not spent a billion dollars toward vaccine research in all the years of research to that point.<span>  </span>Pennsylvania’s roads are seriously in decline, requiring 1.7 billion dollars a year to maintain the bridges, secondary roads and turnpike.<span>  </span>The Iraq War is costing us 10 billion dollars a month (not to mention the cost of private contractors and stipends paid to the Sunni Awakening Group, formerly known as the Sunni insurgents.<span>  </span>The Sunni Awakening is the group which has made The Surge a success…we paid them off.<span>  </span>However, more recently, violence was surged once again because the majority Shiites have cut pay to the Sunni Awakening.)<span>  </span>My math tells me that paying for about five fewer days of the Iraq War could fund the highway infrastructure in Pennsylvania for a whole year. The 700 billion payout that our government has authorized in this latest buyout makes my HIV/PA roads argument petty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Where does the money come from?<span>  </span>The answer is that you as a taxpayer will be ultimately responsible.<span>  </span>Well, not just you…since many of you will not outlive the debt that has befallen our country.<span>  </span>Your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will ultimately bear the burden of this responsibility. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">No one thought Rome would ever fall.<span>  </span>It began with the excesses which included the Games of which the Coliseum was only the major leagues. Paying for all those gladiators (many were professionals), exotic animals and demonstrative displays helped to bankrupt the Roman Empire.<span>  </span>The size of the empire became too unwieldy to defend, taxing the army beyond its capability. The third nail in the coffin was a series of incompetent emperors.<span>  </span>It didn’t happen overnight.<span>  </span>It took a couple of centuries before bordering tribes saw a weakness and delivered the coup’de gras.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">We have already experienced the “Games” portion, the overextension of our military and poor leadership.<span>  </span>However, I cannot see the Canadians or Mexicans taking over America.<span>  </span>But, these times are not as in Roman times.<span>  </span>A country can be overcome from afar by the simply key stroke on a computer.<span>  </span>Everyone has a credit card.<span>  </span>Everyone gets a bill which largely suggests satisfying the minimum payment…usually 15 dollars.<span>  </span>The majority of Americans are engaged in deficit spending and have a net savings of about minus1%.<span>  </span>Our government does exactly the same thing.<span>  </span>If China sells us a trillion dollars of goods, we hope to sell them a trillion in return.<span>  </span>However, the Chinese Yuan is devalued and therefore, the trade is uneven favoring China and increasing our deficit.<span>  </span>So, despite our government’s best intention of paying its monthly bill in full, it pays the minimum…the equivalent of your credit card companies’ 15 dollars.<span>  </span>The interest piles up and because we can’t pay, China buys in to our national debt.<span>  </span>It is difficult to get a handle on just how much of our national debt is owned by China but estimates are in the 20% level…with Japan holding a slight bit more.<span>  </span>What happens if Taiwan (our ally just off the cost of China) creates a problem and calls upon us for support?<span>  </span>Would China tell us to “pay up or shut up”?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">President Bush first suggested that Social Security be nationalized in 2004.<span>  </span>Americans were smart enough to sound off and it was quickly moved to a back burner.<span>    </span>If individuals were left to deal with their own social security, we would have to re-invent the county homes for the indigent.<span>  </span>The events of the past months should illustrate that point.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">The solution to the social security problem is simple.<span>  </span>Most citizens erroneously believe that the money pulled from their weekly paychecks is invested in an account that they will be able to withdraw from when they reach their respective “social security “age. That isn’t the case.<span>  </span>The money coming out of your check is simply going to pay the current SS recipients.<span>  </span>So, as the population ages, there is a greater number of older people to pay for and fewer working people to provide the money.<span>  </span>I saw my obligation to social security rise as my salary rose. <span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span> </span>The answer is to raise the ceiling on social security taxes and build up the surplus.<span>  </span>The ceiling is currently affixed at earnings of $102,000.<span>  </span>Allow those making between a $102,000 and $250,000 to enjoy a respite and then begin taxing at the $250,000 level to $300,000 level.<span>  </span>That would affect less than 1% of the US population.<span>  </span>Also make the government pay back the amount that it has borrowed from the fund, partly to finance the Iraq War.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">More importantly, the government continually tells us that SS will be broke by 2040.<span>  </span>A brief history lesson will tell us that in its incipience, SS had 15 people contributing for a single recipient.<span>  </span>Currently, 1.5 people now pay for one recipient.<span>  </span>It is a simple matter of demographics.<span>  </span>We have aged as a population but, as a population we will not age forever.<span>  </span>By 2040, all people deemed elderly now (including myself) will be dead, and the demographic shift will begin to reverse itself back toward the time of FDR.<span>  </span>The problem of social security should be solved and without all the hand wringing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

<p>Hello Tom,<br/>
Thank you for allowing us readers to agree with or take issue with your synergistic blog. I’ll choose the latter, in the spirit of your blog, as you describe as intertwined science and politics, humor and seriousness and common sense and ideology.<br/>
What fun!<br/>
Let’s start with “predatory lending.” I question whether the loan defaults are the result of that sort of lending, which is a term generally used to describe high interest payday loans, or the result of Jimmy Carter’s Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that required banks to lend in low income areas and furthered in1993 when Bill Clinton ordered new regulations for the CRA which would increase access to mortgage credit for inner city and distressed rural communities. The new rules went into effect on January 31, 1995 and featured: requiring numerical assessments to get a satisfactory CRA rating; using federal home-loan data broken down by neighborhood, income group, and race; encouraging community groups to complain when banks were not loaning enough to specified neighborhood, income group, and race; allowing community groups that marketed loans to targeted groups to collect a fee from the banks.</p>
<p>I also blame the recipients for applying for and accepting those loans knowing full well that they did not have the capacity to repay. Hey, let’s enjoy the good life now, the heck with the future. Equal blame! “Those hapless individuals who began the process by innocently applying to become part of the American dream by owning their own homes” had many opportunities to educate themselves as you did. They chose not to. Their fault! </p>
<p>You write of the government socializing the lending institutions and since socialism is so wonderful, why not socialize everything? Great idea, take away incentive and with what are you left? It’ll be great fun reading your answer!</p>
<p>You drive through town and see “for sale” signs on virtually every block.  So do I and blame it on aging home owners who have moved on to nursing homes and those that have moved out of Uniontown because of high taxes. You’ll see a sign on my house soon and I won’t be going into a nursing home anytime soon.</p>
<p>You know of people who are making mortgage payments on houses that will never be worth what they are paying for them. Boy, some people do some stupid things.</p>
<p>You see homes boarded up that could be made livable. Yeah, but would you live in the neighborhoods they are in?<br/>
I thought about buying a few of those but, well, the tax thing made it not worthwhile.</p>
<p>About your $24,270 Prius. You may break even over my 1997 Ford Fiesta in about 5 years.  Nice you could afford it. You could get a livable home around here for that price but for that tax thing.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point I’m starting to lose sight of your point of this blog. The misguided Iraq war,  the HIV/AIDS pandemic,<br/>
Rome and the Games of the Coliseum, Canadians or Mexicans taking over America,  ahhh, my head is spinning, okay, okay, I can handle this.</p>
<p>You say if individuals were left to deal with their own social security, we would have to re-invent the county homes for the indigent. Oh boy, if only we could all be as smart as you.<br/>
Please Tom, please, I’ll give the government my paycheck before I mishandle it. They always do such a good job with my money.</p>
<p>I have tried but failed to determine the point of this blog by reading and re-reading it. I can only see one recurring theme throughout and that would be your advocacy of socialism (with the exception of your writings on the government bailout of the big three automakers). And that theme is the one thing that bothers me most with this blog.<br/>
Our dabbling with this inherently faulty system is why we are in dire straits.</p>

<p>Hello Ted, I write of the facts…and the facts are that many institutions in America are run on a socialism basis.  Citizens pay progressive taxes and those taxes are inequitably dispersed on a service basis.  That is socialism.  We subsidize some farmers NOT to farm, so that prices can be maintained.  That has the flavor of socialism.  Almost all aspects of American life have a link to socialism.  Joe the Plumber likely benefits more than many as a consequence of the inequitable distribution of services. Even the higher taxes we pay in Uniontown benefit our South Union neighbors in the form of providing them a fire department.  The state taxes collected from all Pennsylvanians provides police protection for South Union which is without a police department.  Like it or not, this satisfies the concept of socialism.<br/>
	On a personal note, the Prius I own is the first and only new car I have ever owned, having driven junkers for most of the 46 years I drove before purchasing the Prius.  I worked and saved for many years and agonized over the decision to buy it.  It turned out to be a good investment despite the fact an automobile is almost never a good investment.  If I keep it ten years, it will have paid for itself.<br/>
	As far as advocating socializing everything, you are putting words in my mouth.  Our government has taken us in that direction in many aspects of American life but the medical community has resisted so far, leaving skyrocketing health insurance costs and in many cases uninsured individuals.  The Hill-Burton Act requires some hospitals to care for the uninsured but still get paid in the form of higher costs for those who enjoy health insurance.  Hmmm…more socialism.<br/>
	As far as incentive, I know of no one who has stopped trying to earn as much money as possible, even when marginal tax rates were astronomically high in the early to middle part of the 20th century.  Incentive and drive are…to a degree… inborn neurological concepts at least partly originating in the temporal lobe of the brain.  Some simply can’t turn it off.  Others may not have quite the same drive.  We are all different.  Genetics provides us with many traits but environment also impacts on our DNA.  Genes control obvious physical traits such as eye color, texture of hair and other characteristics.  Some genes can in turn be impacted by our environment.  Intelligence inheritance studies suggest that intelligence is inherited between 50-70 percent based upon studies of twins who have been separated at birth and raised in different families. The remainder of the intelligence equation is affected by the nurturing that the individual has experienced. This suggests that providing a caring environment can more than make up for any genetic intellectual deficiencies.  The statistics are not great but good enough to still indicate that environment plays a significant role in the development of intelligence and likely drive/incentive as well.<br/>
	The Christian ethic is to help your brother…and sisters/distant cousins. All humans are related as indicated by mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome  studies.  We are familial-disconnected by only a few thousand generations since our ancestors emerged from Africa about 50,000 years ago.  The evidence is overwhelming.  The number of poor people in America has increased over the past eight years.  The number of working poor has increased as well.  The middle class is slowly shrinking.  Yet I see no indication that those individuals struggling financially have given up or are eager to begin accepting welfare.</p>
