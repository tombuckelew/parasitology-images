<p><i>Diphyllobothrium latum</i> exhibits little host specificity as indicated 
by this graphic with humans and bears as two potential definitive hosts.  
These pseudophyllidean tapeworms are located in the small intestine and pass egg 
capsules which exit via a uterine pore.  If the feces are deposited in 
freshwater, embryonation of 8 days to several weeks (depending on temperature) 
results in the emergence of a ciliated known as a coracidium.  Copepods of 
a variety of genera including <i>Cyclops</i> and <i>Diaptomus </i>may ingest the 
coracidium where it develops into a procercoid in the hemocoel of the 
crustacean.  When the infected copepod is eaten by a wide variety of 
freshwater fish, the procercoid develops into a plerocercoid in the muscles of 
the fish.  Smaller fish may serve as paratenic hosts when eaten by larger 
fish.  If humans, bears or any other suitable definitive host eats the fish 
raw or poorly cooked, the plerocercoid develops into the adult worm.  In 
addition, copepods may accidentally be ingested by humans or other definitive 
hosts while drinking copepod-contaminated water.  In those cases, the 
plerocercoid may develop in the definitive or final host as a sparaganum.  
The condition in which plerocercoids or spargana develop in the definitive host 
is known as sparaganosis.  Since the spargana are difficult to identify to 
species, a number of non-human infecting tapeworms may lead to sparganosis 
through accidental ingeston of infected copepods.  <i>Diphyllobothrium 
mansonoides</i>, a tapeworm of cats, is most likely the culprit in sparganosis 
in North America.  </p>
