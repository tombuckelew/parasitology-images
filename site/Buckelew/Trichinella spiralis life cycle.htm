Life Cycle of <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> </p>
<p align="center">

<i>Trichinella spiralis</i> is one of the most common nematode parasites of 
vertebrates. In humans, it is considered a zoonosis since humans represent a 
dead end in the life cycle unless anthropophagy (cannibalism) is involved.  
The larva is considered to be the largest intracellular parasite known, invading 
skeletal muscle of carnivores and molecularly programming the host cell to lose 
its contractile properties, instead becoming a nurse cell, functioning to 
nourish the larva.  The entire life cycle occurs in a single host.  
Ingested larvae are digested free from the meat and in the small intestine, molt 
four times, grow and copulate, while migrating through the intestinal mucosa.  
Males die shortly thereafter and pass out with the feces.  The impregnated 
females migrate through the intestinal wall and deliver live larvae (ovoviparity) 
which reach a blood vessel, pass into the hepatic portal system and migrate 
through the arterial tree, ultlimately reaching a skeletal muscle.  Muscles 
of the eye, tongue, jaws, diaphragm, and rib cage are most heavily parasitized 
and limb and torso muscles to a lesser degree.  <i>Trichinella </i>has 
undergone a taxonomic revolution recently with most authors now considering a 
number of species based largely on its distribution and sensitivity to 
temperature.  <i>T. nativa, </i> characterized in the drawing above, 
is found in the arctic and subarctic and infects polar bears, walruses, and 
seals.  The eating of raw meat is the cause of infection in eskimos.  
It has a high resistance to freezing.  <i>T. britovi</i> and <i>T. spiralis
</i>are found in the temperate zones and cycle between wild woodland animals 
including bears, foxes, wolves and feral pigs all of which may scavenge 
carcasses.  Humans enter the cycle as hunters eating poorly-prepared kills.  
In tropical Africa, <i>T. nelsoni </i>is the variant with a low infectivity for 
rats and pigs instead relying on a variety of carnivores and carrion feeding 
mammals.  Hyenas appear to play an important role.  The domestic or 
urban cycle involves <i>T. spiralis</i> and includes pigs, rats and humans as 
the principle hosts.  Pigs and rats become infected by eating raw garbage 
contaminated with uncooked pork scraps although larvae in rat feces may also 
serve as a source of infection.  Pigs also kill and eat rats which venture 
into their stys.  Pigs also exert territoriality in the sty by biting off 
and eating each other's tails.  Humans become involved by eating raw or 
poorly cooked meat, principally pork as well as other meats.  Raw or 
poorly-cooked sausage serves as a prime source of infection.  In France, 
horsemeat has a high incidence of contamination with larvae, though the 
epidemiology of horse infections is unknown.  The incidence of infection in 
the US has dropped considerably in the latter part of the 20th century, though 
it has risen slightly more recently as raw sausage-loving immigrants enter the 
country.  <i>T. pseudospiralis</i> infects rats but pigs to much lesser 
degree. It may be a parasite of birds.</p>
