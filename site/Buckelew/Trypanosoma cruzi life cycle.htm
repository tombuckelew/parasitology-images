Life Cycle of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi </i></p>

<i>Trypanosoma cruzi </i>causes Chagas disease in Central and South America, 
occasionally appearing in Mexico and the Rio Grande border of the US.  Bugs 
of the family Reduviidae such as <i>Panstrongylus megistus</i> and <i>Triatoma</i> 
spp. serve as vectors.  These bloodsucking bugs, known as assassin or 
kissing  bugs inhabit roof thatching and as well as crevices in the house 
and feed nocturnally. The bug commonly bites in the orbits of the eyes or on and 
around the lips, thus the name kissing bug.  The bite is very painful, 
hence another monicker... assassin bug.  The bug often defecates as it 
feeds and the feces containing the infective metacyclic trypomastigotes, may be 
rubbed into the wound by the victim.  The trypomastigotes are found in 
large numbers in the bloodstream shortly after inoculation, though they soon 
enter cells of the spleen, liver, heart and others tissues where they assume the 
amastigote stage.  It is in the amastigote stage that they quickly divide, 
producing such numbers that they kill the host cell, escape and attack other 
cells.  Promastigotes and epimastigotes can be seen in interstitial spaces 
and some fully develop into trypomastigotes which enter the bloodstream to 
continue the life cycle should they be ingested by a biting assassin bug.  
They multiply in the bug's midgut as epimastigotes, transforming into short 
metacyclic trypomastigotes in about 8-10 days post-infection. A number of 
domestic and wild mammals serve as reservoir hosts, principally, wood rats, 
armadillos, opossums, cats and dogs.  Hosts may be infected by eating 
infected insects and in some villages of Mexico, bugs are eaten as aphrodisiacs, 
leading to infections.  Transplacental transmission occurs resulting in 
newborns with advanced Chagas disease.  Blood transfusions serve as 
potential risk factors.  Coitus and mother's milk are being investigated as 
a possible source of transmission.</p>
