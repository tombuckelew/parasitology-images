egg capsule of<i> Toxocara canis.  </i>The ovoid,  pitted capsule wall 
is typical of this species. It infects canines and poses a considerable 
risk when the egg capsule is ingested by humans.  The migrating larvae 
often lodge in vital organs such as the brain, spinal cord, and eyes causing a 
condition known as visceral larva migrans.  This is the worm you may have 
seen you dog "cough up" or pass in its stool.  Children should be 
forewarned not to kiss dogs or let them lick their faces. 400x</p>
