<p>This individual is suffering from acute elephantiasis.  The most common 
cause of this disfiguring disorder is an infection with a filiarial nematode, 
likely <i>Wuchereria</i> <i>bancrofti</i>.  <i>Onchocerca volvulis</i> could 
also be the culprit as well as <i>Brugia malayi</i>.  In the life cycle of
<i>W</i>. <i>bancrofti</i>, the human host is infected through the bite of at 
least 77 different species of mosquitoes of the genera, <i>Anopheles, Mansonia</i>,
<i>Culex</i>, and <i>Aedes</i>.  The fly delivers filariform larvae to the 
definitive host with its bite, which then travel through smaller lymphatic 
channels, eventually settling in larger lymphatic channels near lymph nodes in 
the lower part of the body, particularly the groin.  There, the worms 
mature and periodically release microfilaria to the bloodstream.  Should a 
subsequent uninfected mosquito suck blood, it may ingest microfilaria, 
continuing the life cycle in the mosquito.  Repeated infections resulting 
in  acute inflammations may lead to a  build up of fibrous connective 
tissue, perhaps compounded by calcified, dead worms.  The lymph channels 
become distended as a result of the back-up of lymph flow and tissues "upstream" 
from the block become edematous, leading to the swelling seen here.  The 
areas most affected include the scrotum and legs, although arms and breasts and 
vulva are also affected.  I would like to cite this brief video but am 
unable to, since a former student sent it to me without citation.  </p>
