<i>Leishmania</i> spp. is the causative agent of a number of diseases in diverse 
locations in the world, roughly referred to as leishmaniasis.  Though as 
many as 20 different species are recognized by some parasitologists, I will 
limit this discussion to five, <i>Leishmania donovani</i>, <i>L. tropica, L. 
major</i>,<i> L. braziliensis</i> and <i>L. mexicana</i>.  <i>L. donovan</i>i,
<i>L. tropica</i> and<i> L. major</i> are transmitted by sand flies of the genus
<i>Phlebotomus, </i>while <i>L. braziliensis </i>and <i>L. mexicana</i> are 
transmitted by the sand fly  genus <i>Lutzomyia.  </i>Sandflies are 
small bloodsuckers capable of passing through ordinary screen mesh in windows 
and doors.  They live below 2000 feet above sea level, usually on plains.  
These "no-see-ums" suck blood and ingest amastigote forms from infected hosts.  
The amastigotes transform into flagellated promastigotes which clog the 
esophagus of the fly.  Feeding flies, regurgitate promastigotes on the skin 
of the victim where they may enter the bite wound.  Amastigotes of the 
different species are indistinguishable and represent one of the smallest 
eukaryotic cell known.  Speciation is dependent on the geography of the 
infection as well as symptoms and disease states of the host.  Visceral 
leishmaniasis is caused by <i>L. donovani</i> and affects mostly the spleen and 
liver. It is known in India as Dum-Dum fever or Kala-azar though it is much more 
widely distributed.  It causes pronounced hepatosplenomegaly.  
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by <i>L. tropica</i> and<i> L. major </i>
causing skin lesions known as oriental sore, Baghdad boil, Delhi boil and other 
common names.  The latter two leishmania are biochemically distinct, cause 
slightly different skin lesions, and do not overlap geographically.  <i>L. 
braziliensis</i> is the cause of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis ranging from Mexico 
to mid-South America.  Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin lesions 
which may be open and oozing, potentially spreading amastigotes to other parts 
of the body or other individuals.  In some parts of South America, the 
disease known as espundia or uta refers to  secondary lesions occuring in 
the nasal passageways or mouth, causing disfiguring sores and gaping holes.  
Sometimes the nasal septum, soft palate and other nasal/oral tissues are eaten 
away.  Secondary infections may occur coincidentally with primary 
infections or many years after the primary infection has healed. <i>L. mexicana<br/>
</i>is found in Mexico, northern Central America, and Texas where it commonly 
causes a cutaneous lesion, though nasal/pharyngeal and visceral infections have 
been seen.  Lumbermen, referred to as chicleros in Latin America, often 
display the badge of their occupation as an eroded ear.....chiclero 
ulcer.....due to an infection which has disintigrated some of the poorly-vascularized 
and therefore less immunocompetent ear cartilage.</p>
