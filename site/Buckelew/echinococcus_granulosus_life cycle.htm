<p><i>Echinococcus granulosus</i> is a tapeworm of dogs and other canines.  
The worms are diminutive, 3-6 mm in length and composed of a scolex and a single 
immature, mature and gravid ploglottid.  <i>Echinococcus</i> employs a 
strategy different from most other taeniids, in that larger taeniids produce 
more eggs per proglottid but are represented by a lesser worm burden.  <i>
Echinococcus</i> worm burdens on the other hand are enormous.  Egg capsules 
are passed in the canine stool contaminating herbage that herbivores may eat.  
In the intermediate host, the eggs develop into endogenous hydatid cysts which 
contain hundreds to thousands of protoscolices.  When a hydatid cyst is 
eaten, each of the protosolices develops into a diminutive adult.  Sheep 
are common intermediate hosts but goats, camels, pigs, kangaroos, and reindeer 
are also intermediates in their respective environs.  Rodents are common 
intermediate hosts of a closely-related species, <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>.  
Humans inadvertently become involved in the life cycles when they ingest egg 
capsules from the stool of canines...mostly dogs.  The result is the 
development of a hydatid cyst in humans.  The cysts often grow to sizes, 
larger than those realized in other intermediate hosts.  Many times, the 
cysts are in the brain, lungs, bones or liver where they crowd out surrounding 
tissue.  There are tribes within Kenya where dog intestine is considered a 
delicacy.  The intestine is cleaned  by merely forcing out the feces 
after which the intestine is scorched on a stick, leaving numerous eggs in the 
intestine still alive.  The Turkana of Kenya leave their dead on burial 
cairns to be eaten by scavengers.  In this instance, humans actually 
represent true intermediate hosts if the bodies are eaten by canine scavengers.  
Sheepherders may be infected by too close an association with their sheep dogs.  
In Lebanon, the tanning industry uses dog feces to help color the leather.  
Those apprentices assigned to collecting dog stools from the street risk 
infection.  Some tribes in Africa train their dogs to lick vomitus off of 
young children's faces, thereby contaminating them with eggs that may be 
clinging to the dog's muzzle as a result of the dog licking it's anus after 
defecating. </p>
