<i>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</i> is a bile duct fluke of ruminants such as sheep, 
goats and deer as well as pigs.  It is often referred to as the lancet 
fluke because of its blade-like form.  It stands apart from most trematodes 
since it has a land-based life cycle.  The definitive host's feces contain 
contain miracidia which do not hatch until after they are eaten by the first 
intermediate host, a land snail, such as <i>Cionella lubrica</i> in the U. S. 
and other species elsewhere.  The miracidium emerges inside the intestine 
of the snail and metamorphoses into a sporocyst in the digestive gland.  
Daughter sporocysts are produced within the mother sporocyst and in turn produce 
xiphidiocercaria which are characterized by having a stylet inside the mouth and 
tails, normal features of aquatic cercaria, despite the fact they terrestrial.  
After around 90 days post-infection, cercarial production fills the mantle 
cavity known as the lung of these air-breathing snails.  The cercaria 
irritate the delicate tissues of the lung, resulting in the defensive production 
of mucous by the snail.  The infestation of the lung, causes the snail to 
cough, expelling mucous, laden with cercaria into its slime trail. As the slime 
dries, the exterior hardens, protecting the cercaria from dessication.  The 
second intermediate host is the common brown ant, <i>Formica fusca</i> in North 
America.  The ants gather  the slime balls containing cercaria and 
feed it to their developing larvae.  Metacercaria develop in the hemocoel 
of the ant and are infective to any definitive host which may accidentally 
ingest ants while grazing.  One or two of the encysted metacercaria encyst 
in the subesophageal ganglion, one portion of the ant brain, and there, 
remarkably alter the ant's behavior, increasing its chances of being eaten by 
the definitive host.  Ants normally retreat to their burrows as the day 
cools in the late afternoon to evening and remain there till mid-day when the 
surface of the soil warms.  However, infected ants climb to the ends of 
blades of grass, clinging by their mandibles, during periods of cool when their 
hivemates have retreated to their burrows.  The consequences of this 
antithetical behavior is that the ant becomes a prime target of accidental 
predation by the grazer.  Upon ingestion by the definitive host, the 
metacercaria excyst in the duodenum and migrate up the common bile duct to the 
liver.  The adult fluke matures in 6-7 weeks, producing egg capsules about 
a month later.  </p>
