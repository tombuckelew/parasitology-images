intestinal phases of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, including "banana bunch" schizonts (upper right and 
elsewhere) and trophozoites (upper left with prominent nucleus and small clear 
area around it).  This is a feline parasite and this section is probably 
from a kitten.  Humans become infected either through cat feces or eating 
raw or poorly cooked meat.  The incidence of infection is quite high in 
many countries, such as France where steak tartare is relished.  1000x<img border="0" height="512" src="images/Toxoplasma gondii intestine schizont.jpg" width="640"/><br/>
"banana bunch" schizont with trophozoite of <i>T. gondii</i> below and slightly to the right. 
<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is one of the most common causes of congenital birth 
defects.  Previously-uninfected women should never handle outdoor cats 
(those that eat rodents) or eat raw meat.  Primary infections occurring 
during pregnancy present the principle risk.  Women, already infected prior 
to the pregnancy, pose no known risk to the developing fetus.  1000x</p>
