<p align="center">Determination of Epidermal Plate Configuration in the 
Miracidium of <i>Megalodiscus temperatus</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>    </i>    The miracidia of 
trematodes have an external surface comprised of ciliated plates (epidermal 
plates) which are arranged in a regular fashion.  The regularity is such 
that in the past, some authors chose to classify the adult trematodes relative 
to the epidermal plate configuration of their miracidia.  The object of 
this exercise is to demonstrate the epidermal plate configuration of the 
miracidium of <i>Megalodiscus temperatus</i>, the rectal fluke of frogs.</p>
<p align="left">PROCEDURE<br/>
 </p>
<p align="left">1.  Excise the recta of a number of <i>Rana pipiens</i> and 
place them in Syracuse dishes with distilled water.<br/>
2.  Tease the recta apart and locate the adult flukes.  <i>
Megalodiscus</i> <i>temperatus</i> is characterized by two red-brown caeca and a 
large terminal acetabulum.<br/>
3.  Transfer the adult flukes to separate dishes containing filtered 
aquarium water or pond water.  The adults will begin depositing numerous 
egg capsules.<br/>
4.  Transfer the egg capsules to a separate dish.  The miracidia will 
hatch within the next minutes to hours.<br/>
5.  After the greatest number of miracidia have hatched, quickly pipette 
hot (60-70C) freshly-prepared,  0.5% silver nitrate into the depression 
slide and allow the miracidia to settle to the bottom.  Circular agitation 
of the dish can be used to concentrate them toward the middle.<br/>
6. Pipette (Pasteur pipettes) off the excess silver nitrate and replace it with 
distilled water.  Repeat this procedure several times.  This should be 
done while observing with a dissecting microscope to insure that the miracidia 
are not also pipetted off and discarded.  To reduce the possibility of 
inadvertently discarding miracidia, reduce the bore of the Pasteur pipette.  
To do this, place the tip of a 9 inch Pasteur pipette in the flame of a Bunsen 
burner. When the tip is molten, pull the glass apart and the bore of the tip 
will be reduced.  With practice, pipettes can be modified so that 
individual miracidia can be pipetted "single file".<br/>
7.  Expose the miracidia to direct sunlight for 3-10 minutes dependent upon 
the cloud cover that day.<br/>
8.  Dehydrate through an ascending series of ethanols, clear with xylene 
and mount with permount.  (Xylene is carcinogenic and should only be worked 
with in a fume hood).  An alternate technique to the use of permount would 
be to place the miracidia in a 10 % glycerine solution and allow the water to 
evaporate, bringing the medium gradually to pure glycerine.  The latter 
technique utilizes glycerine jelly as the mounting medium and a double mount 
technique should be employed.<br/>
9.  Photograph the miracidia shortly after they have been mounted.  
The reduced silver nitrate clings to the edges of the epidermal plates, nicely 
delineating them.  However, as the time passes, the silver continues to be 
reduced, blackening the miracidia.</p>
