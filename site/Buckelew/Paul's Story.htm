<p class="MsoNormal">    I have a fringe benefit most people only experience in 
their dreams.  My best friend, my across-the-street neighbor, my antiquing 
buddy, and beer drinking philosopher is also my PHYSICIAN.  As a parasitologist 
AND physiologist, I  often go off with him on some antiquing soiree only to end 
up discussing the intricacies of the renin-angiotensin reflex or some exotic 
case of parasitism.  I can never top him with one of my experiences, for he can 
routinely come back with an equally absurd happenstance.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    He has doctored in 
Alabama, Virginia, and most recently in Pennsylvania.  He related to me an 
account of a Vietnamese immigrant who was being treated unsuccessfully for 
tuberculosis even though he didnt prove positive in a tuberculin test.  He 
noticed that the immigrant had a brown-flecked sputum and realizing his country 
of origin, decided to look further.  In Southeast Asia, a delicacy is a dish 
called drunken crab which is marinated, but still raw crab, having been soaked 
overnight in wine.  The marination does not kill any parasites the crab may 
contain and is a significant epidemiological factor in the spread of <i>
Paragonomiasis</i>.  The infectious organism is <i>Paragonimus westermani</i> 
though today, taxonomic splitters have created numerous other species.  A 
microscopic examination of the Vietnamese patients sputum revealed the presence 
of  egg capsules, recognizable as that of <i>Paragonimus</i>.  The patient 
survived.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">     Another case involved preliminary lab tests preceding a multiple 
cardiac bypass.  The results included an unusually high level of eosinophils in 
the bloodstream.  As brilliant as thoracic surgeons are with their eye/hand 
mastery of dexterity, they often have left their diagnostics skills back in 
medical school.  In their concern for this unusual hematological find, they went 
back to their textbooks to look for a cause wanting to make sure they crossed 
all their Ts and dotted their Is before surgery.  Look up eosinophilia and one 
diagnosis will suggest eosinophilic leukemia.  Look a little further and the 
reader will realize that eosinophilic leukemia is rare but eosinophilia is more 
commonly associated with a helminth infections.  Common causes include 
trichinosis, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis.  My physician friend looked 
beyond the remote eosinophilic leukemia and requested a stool examination.  The 
lab tech immediately recognized egg capsules and  larvae which proved to be of
<i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>.  As an afterthought, the docs realized the 
patient had intermittent colitis for which a cause had never been identified. 
<i>Strongyloidiasis</i> is often difficult to diagnose.  Case solvedand the 
bypass surgery was successful as well.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    The most unbelievable of his experiences 
however, involved a sewer worker in Virginia.  This particular worker went to 
the emergency room with a severe case of shortness of breath and pneumonia-like 
symptoms.  After a chest X-ray followed up by blood tests ruled out pneumonia, 
my physician friend looked further and diagnosed (correctly) a case of<i> 
leptospirosis</i>.  This is caused by a bacterium which is tangential to my 
expertise and this websites direction, but I thought this factual account was 
compelling enough to include.  <i> Leptospirosis</i> is a rodent parasite which 
occasionally infects humans exposed to rat urine.  The trencherman in question 
and his co-workers followed a daily routine at lunch.  After leaving the ditch, 
they would go to a nearby picnic table, unwrap their lunches, and then proceed 
across the street to a soda machine to get a drink.  When they returned, the 
workman in this case, discovered a rat was about to begin munching on his 
sandwich.  He ran to the picnic table and startled the rat which proceeded to 
urinate on his sandwich.  Hungry as he was, and accustomed to less than sanitary 
lunchroom facilities, he cut away the part of the sandwich he thought the rat 
urinated on.  Apparently, his dissection of the sandwich was incomplete.</p>
