Lice Cycle of <i>Schistosoma mansoni<br/>
</i>
<img border="0" height="662" src="images/Ultrastructure/Schistosoma-drawing.jpg" width="780"/><br/>
The dioecious adults of <i>Schistosoma mansoni </i>live in the portal veins, 
such as the posterior mesenteric which drains the large intestine.  The 
females spend much of their time, housed in the gynecophoric groove of the male 
where copulation takes place.  Egg capsules are deposited by the female 
which work their way through the wall of the vein into the adjacent large bowel.  
The mechanism of this migration through the vein and colon wall is still in 
question.  Once in the large intestine, the egg capsules with the contained 
miracidium, exit along with the feces. Many ova (egg capsules) do not enter the 
lumen but remain surrounded by eosinophils and macrophages as a granuloma.   
If deposited in freshwater, the ciliated, miracidium will hatch  and swim 
from 2-6 hours  in search of a specific snail host.  The principle 
snail hosts are of the genera, <i>Biomphalaria </i>spp., mostly in the old 
world, and <i>Tropicorbis</i> <i>centrimetralis</i> in Brazil.  Once in the 
proper snail host, the miracidium sheds its epidermal plates and transforms into 
a mother sporocyst.  The mother in turn produces daughter sporocysts in 6-7 
weeks.  The daughter sporocysts produce ciliated, furcocercous cercariae 
with typical forked tails.  The furcocercous cercariae of the various 
schistosomes are indistinguishable.  Schistosomes have no second 
intermediate host, but instead, the cercariae swim to the surface and sink to 
the bottom over the course of about 3 days in search of a human host.  If 
the cercariae come in contact with human skin, they penetrate the skin, aided by 
digestive secretions of the penetration glands.  The cercariae drop their 
tails in the penetration process and are then referred to as schistosomules.  
These schistosomules enter the circulation within 24 hours of penetration, 
following the venous return to the right heart though some follow the lymphatic 
pathway to the subclavian before entering the right heart.  In passing 
through the capillaries of the lungs, many are lost.  Those which 
successfully navigated through the lung capillaries are carried by the left 
heart to the mesenteric arteries.  From there, the schistosomules must be 
able to pass through the capillary bed to the hepatic portal system, reaching 
the liver.  There, males and females pair up and migrate to their 
destination in the posterior mesenteric veins, bordering the large intestine.</p>
