cercaria of <i>Paragonimus westermani</i> of the microcercous form with a rudimentary tail (button) seen to the 
extreme right.  This cercaria will emerge from its snail host, family 
Thieridae, and rather 
than swimming will "inch" along wet rocks, seeking its crab or crayfish host (11 
different species).  There is the possibility that crabs and crayfish hosts 
may become infected by eating infected snails.  400x</p>
