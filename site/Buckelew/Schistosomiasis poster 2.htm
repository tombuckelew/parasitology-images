This poster is entitled, Use the Toilet.  It was a common scene during Jim 
Fedorko's stay in the Philippines to see someone defecating alongside the road 
in public view.  The second bold statement in Wari-Wari, includes the 
message, "in addition, neither move your bowels in a brook, canal, rice field, 
nor near the edges, so that you don't spread schistosomiasis".  Published 
by the Department of Health, Republic of the Philippines.</p>
