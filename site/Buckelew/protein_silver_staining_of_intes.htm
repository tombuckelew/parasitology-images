<title>Flagellate Stain</title>

<p align="center">Protein Silver Staining of Intestinal Flagellates</p>
<p align="left">OBJECT</p>
<p align="left">   This staining method will allow the student to 
differentiate the rather exotic intracellular morphology of flagellates found in 
the frog rectum or termite intestine.  The student will become familiar 
with chemical preparation and the discipline necessary to perform this rather 
laborious stain technique.  Another object of this project is to 
familiarize the student with the morphology and identification of the different 
organisms found in the frog rectum and termite intestine. I was taught this 
technique by Felix H. Lauter, many years ago in graduate school.</p>
<p align="left">METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR PROTEIN-SILVER IMPREGNATION</p>
<p align="left">    <u>Materials</u></p>
<p align="left">    live <i>Rana pipiens</i> and termites<br/>
    dissecting tools and trays<br/>
    microscopes, slides and cover slips<br/>
    Coupling jars of Columbia staining dishes<br/>
    incubator<br/>
    albumen slide fixative<br/>
    Hollande's fixative<br/>
    ethanol-absolute, 95%,70%, 50% and 30%<br/>
    distilled water<br/>
    xylene<br/>
    0.25% potassium permanganate<br/>
    2.0 % oxalic acid<br/>
    1.5% protargol<br/>
    copper wire<br/>
    1% hydroquinone<br/>
    0.5 % gold chloride<br/>
    5% sodium thiosulfate<br/>
    permount<br/>
    slide labels<br/>
    applicator sticks<br/>
    glacial acetic acid</p>
<p align="left">PROCEDURE</p>
<p align="left">    1.  Coat a meticulously-clean glass 
slide or cover slip with a minute amount of albumen fixative (Mayer).  I 
seem to have better success working with cover slips but they obviously are more 
fragile and prone to breakage.<br/>
    2.  Add a concentrate of rectal contents or intestinal 
contents of either frog flagellates or termite flagellates to the coated slide 
and allow to partially air dry.  This is a critical step because the 
majority of the flagellates will eventually wash off the slide in the numerous 
solution transfers.  The drying will occur from the outer edge of the smear 
inwardly.  Allow the outer edge to dry before you proceed. You should have 
enough Coupling/Columbia jars prepared and labeled for each of the transfers.  
Each of the following steps will involve moving the slides/cover slips from jar 
to jar and therefore solution to solution.  The alternative of dumping the 
previous solution and adding the next solution in the same jar is too disruptive 
and will eventually wash all surface content off the slide/cover slip.<br/>
    3.  Fix in Hollande's fixative for 20 minutes at room 
temperature in a Coupling jar (if your smear is on a slide) or a Columbia 
staining dish (if your smear is on a cover slip). Each can hold four slides or 
cover slips.  Make sure to mark one side of the jar or dish so you can 
remember which side of the slide/cover slip the smear is on.  I have had 
students get to the end of this laborious technique, only to wipe the smear off 
rather than the opposite side.<br/>
    4.  Wash in two changes of distilled water to remove the 
yellowish tinge (excess picric acid).  The picric acid used in Hollande's 
is potentially explosive if allowed to dry, so be careful.<br/>
    5.  Transfer the slide/cover slip to 50% ethanol for 2 
minutes.<br/>
    6.  Transfer the slide/cover slip to 30% ethanol for 2 
minutes.<br/>
    7.  Transfer sequentially through 3 changes of distilled 
for water for a total of 2 minutes.<br/>
    8.  Bleach in 2.0% aqueous oxalic acid for 10 minutes.<br/>
    9.  Wash in tap water for 2 minutes (3 changes).<br/>
    10.  Place in fresh 1.5% protargol; this is made by 
sprinkling the protargol powder on the surface of distilled water in a clean 
beaker and allowing to dissolve overnight.  Do not heat or stir and place 
the beak in the dark.<br/>
    11.  Add 5 gm of copper wire per 100 ml of protargol to 
the staining jar/dish before use.<br/>
    12.  Stain for 33 hours, changing the staining solution 
after 24 hours (including the addition of fresh protargol and copper).  The 
staining time has been determined by trial and error.<br/>
    13.  Wash in distilled water for 30 seconds.<br/>
    14.  Place in a solution of 1% hydroquinone in 5% 
aqueous sodium sulfite for 10 minutes.<br/>
    15.  Wash several times in distilled water (3 changes of 
3, 3, and 2 minutes).<br/>
    16.  Place in 0.5% aqueous gold chloride for 5 minutes.<br/>
    17.  Wash in distilled water (2 changes, totalling three  
minutes).<br/>
    18.  Place in 2% oxalic acid for 5 minutes until a 
purplish hue appears on the smear.<br/>
    19.  Wash several times in distilled water (4 changes, 
total of 10 minutes).<br/>
    20.  Place in 5 % sodium thiosulfate for 10 minutes.<br/>
    21.  Wash several times in distilled water (4 changes 
for a total of 10 minutes).<br/>
    22.  Dehydrate through a graded series of ethanols, 30%. 
50%, 70%, 95% and absolute for 2 minutes each.<br/>
    23.  Clear in xylene for 1 minute.  The xylene 
should be used in a hood since it is toxic and carcinogenic.<br/>
    24.  Mount thinly with permount.  Make sure you 
mount the smear down.  I have known students to mistakenly have turned the 
slide or cover slip around during the various transfers and ended up mounting 
the smear on top, where it is quickly rubbed off.  </p>
<p align="left">DISCUSSION</p>
<p align="left">    Obviously, this stain technique is not for 
the inexperienced student, nor the easily-frustrated person.  There are 
quite a few pitfalls along the way but the presentation of flagella, parabasal 
bodies, kinetoplasts, axostyles and other exotic morphology of these flagellates 
is without comparison.  Proper precautions should be taken working with the 
above chemicals, some of which are toxic or dangerous.  Students or lab 
workers should read all chemical bottle labels and take proper precautions.</p>
