This is a section through a number of oocysts of <i>Plasmodium</i> spp, clinging 
to the outside surface of the gut in a mosquito.  Each oocyst contains numerous sporozoites, giving them a 
feathery interior appearance.  To the right are a number of ookinetes 
(bluish in vacuoles) that are migrating through the gut wall and will encyst on the outside of the gut and 
develop into oocysts.  Liberated sporozoites make their way through the 
hemolymph of the hemocoel to the salivary glands.  The exoskeleton of the insect has been removed in 
the tissue preparation.  400x</p>
