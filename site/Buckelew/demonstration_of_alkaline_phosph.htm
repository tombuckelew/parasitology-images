<title>Demonstration of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Various Cercaria
</title>

<p align="center">Demonstration of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in Various 
Cercaria</p>
<p align="left">    Trematode miracidia and cercariae produce a 
variety of digestive enzymes which are used to physiologically digest a pathway 
into an intermediate host.  A variety of enzymes are believed to be 
present, including the phosphatases.  The Gomori calcium-cobalt method for 
detection of alkaline phosphatase is a histochemical method of localizing the 
site of alkaline phosphatase activity.  This stain technique involves a 
series of inorganic replacement reactions, the final reaction resulting in the 
formation of an insoluble, visible precipitate--thereby pinpointing the original 
site of enzyme activity.<br/><br/>
SOLUTIONS</p>
<p align="left">    I.  3% sodium beta-glycerophosphate<br/>
    II.  2% calcium chloride<br/>
    III.  10% magnesium chloride<br/>
    IV.  2% cobalt sulfate<br/>
    V.   1 % ammonium sulfide (1ml/100 ml distilled 
water)<br/>
SUBSTRATE SOLUTION<br/>
    10 ml of #I, 10 drops of #III, and 1 gram of sodium barbital 
with the pH of the solution adjusted to 9.2 with 0.1 N NaOH.  Adjust the 
volume to 50 ml with distilled water</p>
<p align="left">PROCEDURE</p>
<p align="left">1.  Obtain cercariae from river or pond snails that have a 
history of containing cercariae.  If none are available, Carolina Biological 
Supply has cercaria-laden snails available.<br/>
2.  Tease apart the snails and obtain the cercariae from the debris. 
Transfer the cercariae to depression slides filled with distilled water. Wash by 
pipetting the distilled water off and replacing it with fresh distilled water.  
Perform this act a number of times, until the cercaria are free of snail tissue 
debris.<br/>
3.  Fix the cercariae with buffered formalin with 1% calcium chloride added 
for 10 minutes.<br/>
4.  Remove the fixative and wash with distilled water and number of times, 
removing the excess fixative.  Pasteur pipettes should be used in the fluid 
transfers.  Small bore Pasteur pipettes can be created by heating the tips 
of 9 inch pipettes in a Bunsen burner flame and pulling them when they are 
molten to create a bore small enough to handle cercariae one-at-a time.<br/>
5.  Incubate the cercariae in the filtered, sodium beta-glycerophosphate 
substrate (listed above)  for 2 hours at 37 C in a depression slide.  
Make sure the depression slide is covered or the substrate will totally 
evaporate.<br/>
6.  Remove the substrate and wash repeatedly with distilled water.<br/>
7.  Treat with ammonium sulfide for 2 minutes.<br/>
8.  Wash repeatedly with distilled water.<br/>
9.  Dehydrate through a graded series of ethanols to absolute ethanol.<br/>
10.  Clear in xylene for 2 minutes (xylene is carcinogenic and should only 
be used in a fume hood).<br/>
11.  Mount with permount.<br/>
12.  Photograph the microscopic image.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
If the enzyme, alkaline phosphatase is present, it will  remove the 
phosphate group from the sodium glycerophosphate in the substrate used in 
incubating the cercariae.  The calcium ions will combine with the phosphate 
ions producing calcium phosphate.  Subsequent treatment with cobalt sulfate 
will enact a transfer reaction resulting in  the cobalt ions combining with 
the phosphate, creating cobalt phosphate.  With the addition of ammonium 
sulfide, the cobalt will claim the sulfide ion and create a black precipitate of 
cobalt sulfide.  That precipitate will mark the site of the original 
alkaline phosphatase presence.</p>
