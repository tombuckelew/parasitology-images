miracidium of <i>Megalodiscus temperatus</i> from<i> Rana pipiens</i>.  
This is a section through the coils of the excretory duct leading from the flame 
cell.  The large body in the center is the nucleus of the cells which 
develop into the ducts.  There are a number of nuclei along the length of 
the duct though not seen here.  Note that the ducts have indentations in the surface, increasing 
internal surface area, and suggesting there may be a reabsorptive function. The 
black granules throughout the frame are glycogen granules.  This miracidium 
is non-feeding and uses glycogen as its principle energy source while seeking 
its snail host.  20,000x.</p>
