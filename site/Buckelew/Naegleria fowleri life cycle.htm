<i>Naegleria fowleri </i>is a the cause of primary amebic meningoencephalitis.  
This is a brain disorder that is almost invariably fatal resulting from the 
invasion of the brain by this facultative parasite.  <i>N. fowleri</i> 
exists as a free-living organism in freshwater ponds and lakes, and possibly 
swimming pools and is quite common.  It is believed that diving into 
"swimming holes" in which amoebae are stirred up from the bottom and are 
aspirated into the nasal passageways represent the principle epidemiological 
factor.  The organism exists in an amoeboid as well as a biflagellated 
form.  It is believed the biflagellated form is the invasive stage and 
reverts to the amoeboid form when invading the cribiform plate through which the 
olfactory nerves pass to the brain.  The amoebae pass into the brain where 
they lyse brain tissue.  It is a rare disease usually only diagnosed during 
an autopsy.  Cooling pools of power plants are often inhabited by this 
amoeba.  Run-off from such plants may contaminate nearby waterways.
