<p align="left">II.  Diagnose the following disorders. (15 point)</p>
<p align="left">1.  A cashier at a small grocery store in South Carolina 
frequented by migrant farm workers has developed a serious bronchial condition.  
The pulmonary condition passes but shortly thereafter a rash develops and the 
individual is unable to sleep.  What organism would you suspect has caused 
this and how would you validate your suspicions?</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">2.  A Tourist visiting southern China feels stifled by the 
restriction place upon him by the tour guide and to rectify the situation and 
improve the enjoyment of his trip, he befriends a native and is invited to 
dinner at his rural home.  The meal is different by western standards and 
includes amongst other things, unshelled water chestnuts, raw fish and fried 
rice.  Upon returning within two week to the US, he develops a severe, 
chronic headache, coupled with intestinal discomfort.  Upon seeing a number 
of physicians, he discovers there are two different helminth ova in his stool.  
What organisms were likely  encountered and how would you identify them?  
(Include drawings)</p>

<p align="left">3.  A young married couple decide to celebrate a

barbecue in which pork and beef were served.  Within a few days, the wife

involved.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>

fecal/oral in their transmission.  Provide one epidemiological factor which 
details how they have been shown to be transmitted.  </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">V.  List ten helminths.  Create a taxonomic key based 
upon the ova morphology.  Hint....use size, opercula, embryonation, shell 
features, and internal morphology as criteria.  (20 points)</p>
