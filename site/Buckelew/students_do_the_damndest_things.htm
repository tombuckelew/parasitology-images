I have been teaching parasitology for more than 30 years.  I must admit that I 
have thoroughly enjoyed every class during those years, despite the difference 
in performance amongst many of the students.  I have had super groups and 
sub-par groups but without variance, they were all enjoyable and memorable. One 
of the first times I taught the course, there was a cadre of about five students 
who excelled.  Today, four of the five are Ph.D.s, three of whom are involved in 
college teaching and one, a colleague in my department.  The sole member of that 
elite group who did not earn a Ph. D. is a successful businesswoman and is 
probably earning more than any of the others.  
<p>    Late one night, I received a call 
from one of those students, many years after he had graduated.  He apologized 
for calling so late, but urgently needed to hear what opinion I might have 
concerning a problem with his child.  He complained that his daughter had become 
infected with <i>Ascaris </i>and he wanted to know how that may have occurred.  
We small-talked for awhile, during which I ascertained he was a genetics 
counselor at a local hospital.  He had bought a small farm in the Pittsburgh 
area and was practicing organic gardening, raising tomatoes, beans, corn etc. 
and a few pigs.  He had gotten into the practice of fertilizing his plants with 
pig manure and wondered aloud if somehow the ascarids his pigs were being 
treated for could possibly have contaminated his produce and ultimately infected 
his daughter.  At the time, there was considerable doubt that <i>Ascaris</i> <i>
lumbricoides</i> (from humans) and <i>Ascaris suum</i> (from pigs) were 
infective to the pig or human hosts, respectively, so I suggested that it was 
improbable, but without any other risk factors, may be the source of his 
daughters infection.  Today, the literature states that cross-infection has 
occurred and that denticles on the oral lips which distinguish the two species 
wear down and make identification to species difficult. It is hypothesized that 
one has likely evolved from the other, each occupying hosts which are quite 
similar metabolically supporting the contention that his daughter was very 
likely infected by vegetables contaminated with <i>Ascaris</i>-infected pig 
manure. </p>
<p>  Another instance involving a parasitology student occurred in my first year of 
teaching.  My student assistant brought me a couple of  foot-long, slender, 
tangled worms in a bottle that she claimed her dog coughed up.  Ordinarily, I 
would not have been able to identify the worms, though they resembled 
nematodes.  However, I had  finished an in-depth invertebrate zoology course in 
graduate school a couple of years before and had seen that worm and so could 
identify it.  I asked my student if she had actually seen her dog cough up the 
worm.  She said she hadnt but the dog was standing by the worm watching it 
wriggle and she naturally assumed the dog was the former owner.  I asked her if 
there were any insects in the vicinity of the worm.  She sheepishly replied yes, 
but asked me not to repeat it because her mother was embarrassed over the fact 
they had cockroaches and certainly did not want Herr Professor to suspect she 
was untidy.  I poked further and found out that her mothers clothes washer 
routinely leaked, leaving a puddle on the basement floor and a cockroach was 
floating in the water.  The roach was not dead but weakened and sort of broken 
open. She assumed it had been smashed.   What she had mistaken for a dog 
nematode was a nematomorphan worm.</p>
<p>      The phylum Nematomorpha is a minor phylum, 
consisting entirely of worms parasitic in insects, mostly beetles and crickets, 
both orthopterans, the family to which cockroaches also belong.  These worms are 
often called horsehair worms since legend in the days of spontaneous generation 
acceptance, suggested they developed from hairs that fell from the mane of 
horses into watering troughs where they were often seen.  Water does play a 
major role in the eruption of the adults from the insect host. The juveniles 
exist in insects and emerge at maturity when insects enter water.  There is some 
research to suggest that infected insects are more likely to enter small bodies 
of water than those which are uninfected.  Once in water, the juveniles emerge 
from their insect host and quickly finish maturation.  They then become 
entangled in a Gordian Knot, so named after King Gordius of Phrygia who tied 
an untieable knot only to be outdone by Alexander the Greats sharp knife.  The 
entanglement or Gordian knot is simply a copulatory position.  The 
nematomorphans are often referred to as Gordian worms. </p>
