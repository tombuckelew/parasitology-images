Life Cycle of
<i>Toxoplasma gondii.</i></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" height="1073" src="images/ultrastructure/Toxoplasma-drawing.jpg" width="780"/><br/>
<i>Toxoplasma gondii </i>was first discovered in a north African rat, the gondi 
in the early part of the 20th century.  During the early 20th century,  
the biology of <i>Toxoplasma</i> was ill-understood with mid-20th century texts 
including it with either the fungal groups or protozoa depending on the author.  
With the advent of effective electron microscopy in the 1960s, the apical 
complex was visualized, forever placing it within the phylum Apicomplexa of the 
Kingdom Protista.  It is an intracellular parasite of numerous tissues, 
particularly skeletal muscle, intestine and nervous tissue.  The cycle 
includes an intestinal phase (enteroepithelial) in domestic cats and other 
felines and an extraintestinal phase in cats and non-cats.  The 
extraintestinal phase may occur in a number of non-cat hosts, such as humans, 
where the disease toxoplasmosis is evident.  Rats and other mammals, 
including  food animals such as pigs, cattle and sheep are commonly 
involved in the extraintestinal phase of the life cycle.  Humans become 
infected through ingestion of poorly cooked meat and also via sporocyst 
ingestion from cat feces. Infected rats may be predated by cats, perpetuating 
the life cycle.  Oocysts fragment into two sporocysts, each of which 
contain 4 sporozoites.  Ingested sporocysts, zoitocysts and occasionally 
tachyzoites  may  lead to intestinal infections in cats.  The 
extraintestinal phase of the life cycle often occurs when zoitocysts containing 
bradyzoites are ingested, though ingested tachyzoites or sporocysts may also 
lead to infections in non-cats, most notably humans.  The above diagram 
warns that pregnant women should never be given the job of cleaning the pet 
cat's litter box.  Should a women who was <i>Toxoplasma</i>-free before her 
pregnancy, become infected for the first time during a pregnancy, the chances of 
her delivering a congenitally-infected child are very high, about 45% of such 
pregnancies.  About 3500 children are born each year in the US with 
congenital toxoplasmosis.  Tachyzoites are the active dividing phase during 
acute infections and may enter the brain, heart or skeletal muscles where they 
multiply more slowly as bradyzoites.  In those tissues, bradyzoite clusters 
become encysted and are known as zoitocysts.  The cyst formation coincides 
with developing immune responses which usually confer permanent immunity in that 
host.  In immunoincompetent individuals such as AIDS victims, bradyzoites 
may emerge from zoitocysts and wreak new havoc.  Toxoplasmosis is one of 
the most common opportunistic diseases associated with AIDS.  Backyard 
barbecuers inadequately cooking meat, steak tartare (raw beef) commonly eaten in 
France and also by gourmets and intrepid diners here in the US, and butchers 
through hand contamination,  represent significant human sources of 
infection.  Cats which are feral or even the pet outdoor cat are prime 
sources of infection.  Any cat which eats rodents should be considered a 
potential source of infection, even though it may only "shed" sporocysts for a 
brief period of time after infection.  </p>
