The acetabulum is large spherical body in the foreground with the genital pore 
to the right.  The black bodies are egg capsules migrating up the uterus 
and one can be seen to the right of the acetabulum. The duct it is in is the 
uterus and it ends at the genital pore a short distance beyond.  The large 
body in the vicinity of the genital pore is the cirrus. This fluke, <i>
Fasciola hepatica</i> was one of the earliest described parasites, in 1379.  
It causes liver rot in sheep. 100x<br/>

The central spheroidal body is the ootype in this specimen of <i>F. hepatica</i>.  The brown lines (vertical) are vitelline ducts and they meet in the vitelline reservoir before entering the 
ootype.  The large, branched body terminating in the ootype is the ovary.  
Egg capsules (brown) can be seen exiting the ootype (to the right).  The 
testes can be seen as globular bodies to the left.  The large, dark, 
branched, horizontal bodies are the caeca.  100x</p>
