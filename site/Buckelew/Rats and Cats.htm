<p class="MsoNormal">    As a graduate student at the University of South Carolina, 
one of my jobs was to care for the laboratory rats.  A small colony was kept for 
laboratory experiments in physiology and parasitology.  It was my job to infect 
rats with <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> and <i>Hymenolepis</i> <i>diminuta</i> for 
the parasitology labs (similar to lab exercises outlined in another part of this 
website).  I learned very quickly that one shouldnt go overboard to insure an 
infection.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    For the <i>Trichinella</i> infections, I would fast a rat for 24 
hours and then give it a morsel of a drawn and sugar-cured but uncooked rat 
supplied by Carolina Biological Company.  The larvae of <i>Trichinella</i> are 
in the skeletal muscle but some muscles are more heavily infected than others.  
It appears that muscles of higher metabolic activity such as jaw, eye, tongue, 
intercostals and especially diaphragm have heavy concentrations of larvae.  As a 
young, inexperienced student, I certainly didnt want to disappoint my professor 
by inadequately infecting the rats.  So, I made sure by giving them ample 
portions of the above-mentioned muscles.  One rat was simply given the skull 
with attached muscles.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    Not only did I successfully infect the necessary dozen 
rats, but three died during the first three days of acute intestinal distress.  
It is during that period that the larvae have attained adulthood and are active 
burrowing through the mucosal lining.  Apparently, I had overdosed a few and 
they died of intestinal bleeding.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    However, one of the most remarkable events 
that occurred during my rat care days was a bit of serendipity associated with 
the infection of rats with <i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i> .  When the parasitology 
students sacrificed their infected rats in the laboratory in preparation for 
slide making, one rat had a prominent, pearly-white nodule positioned on its 
liver.  We were all curious as to what it was, suspecting it to be a cancer of 
some sort.  Felix Lauter, my advisor carefully dissected it out and pronounced 
it to be a strobilocercous of <i>Taenia taeniaformis</i>, a tapeworm of cats.  
In the life cycle of this worm, rats serve as the intermediate host, becoming infected with 
egg capsules in food contaminated by cat feces.  The curious nature of this 
infection was that these rats had not ever been out of their cages, nor had 
their parents, grandparents and so on for countless generations.  How then, did 
that rat become infected?  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    The beauty of parasitism is that though 
many hosts are likely to become infected because of their habits and habitats, a 
few infections appear under the most improbable situation.  This was one of 
them. The likely scenario which resulted in this infection probably involved rat 
chow contaminated at the factory by a infected cat.  Factories with 
ingredients for making animal chow are havens for rodents and where there are 
rodents, there are also cats, whether they are pets or feral animals.  One 
need only think about Philadelphias Veteran Stadium (which has since been 
demolished).  It had become a rat and cat haven with many of the 
ballplayers recognizing particular felines by their coats and calling them by 
name. </p>
