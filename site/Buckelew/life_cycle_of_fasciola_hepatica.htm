<p align="center">
<img align="center" border="0" height="776" src="images/Ultrastructure/Fasciola drawing.jpg" width="750"/><br/>
<i>Fasciola hepatica</i> infects numerous mammals, especially cows, sheep and 
other ruminants, existing in the bile passages of the liver.  The egg 
capsules are passed via bile to the small intestine, travel through the large 
intestine to ultimately be deposited into the environment through feces.  
Should the feces be deposited in water, the egg capsules will embryonate and in 
about 9-10 days in warm weather, hatch, liberating the miracidium.  This 
ciliated, non-feeding larvae will seek out snails of <i>Stagnicola bulimoides</i> 
or <i>Fossaria modicella</i> in the US but other related snails in other parts 
of the world.  Within the snail host, the miracidium transforms into a 
sporocyst which in turn produces redia known as mother redia since they will 
produce daughter redia.  These intramolluscan stages will give rise to 
cercaria of the gymnocephalus type which contain cystogenous glands that enable 
them to form encysted metacercaria on vegetation or in the water.  Should 
the metacercaria-infected vegetation end up "high and dry" and be eaten or 
should the host drink the metacercaria-contaminated water, these minute, 
immature worms excyst in the small intestine, penetrate the lining of the 
intestine and creep over internal organs till they find the liver.  There 
the young worms will invade the capsule of the liver and wander about through 
the hepatic cells, feeding and growing until they enter the bile ducts about 2 
months post-infection.  About one month after entering the liver, the worms 
attain adulthood and begin producing egg capsules.</p>
