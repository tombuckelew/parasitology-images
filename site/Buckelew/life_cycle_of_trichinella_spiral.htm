<p align="center">The Life Cycle of <i>Trichinella spiralis</i></p>
<p align="left">    <i>Trichinella spiralis</i> infects, perhaps, 
a wider range of hosts than any other parasite.  In recent years, 
"splitter" taxonomists have subsequently named other species, largely dependent 
on the geographic range of this nematode.  Many vertebrates are susceptible 
and even invertebrates are believed to be involved as paratenic hosts.  The 
object of this exercise is to demonstrate the life cycle of this worm in the 
laboratory rat by feeding it skeletal muscle laden with larvae.</p>
<p align="left">PROCEDURE</p>
<p align="left">1.  Starve a suitable number of rats for 12 hours (allow 
them water ad libidum), and feed a piece of <i>Trichinella-</i>infected skeletal 
muscle to the rat.  Sucrose-preserved, infected rat muscle can be obtained 
from Carolina Biological Supply Company.  This muscle contains live larvae 
and should be treated with great caution since<i> Trichinella</i> is a human 
pathogen.  Gloves should be worn at all time when handling the meat and all 
contaminated glassware and dissecting tools should be boiled or autoclaved 
afterward.  The muscles with heaviest concentrations of larvae are the 
intercostals, diaphragm, eye muscles, tongue and facial muscles.  The 
muscles of the axis are also infected but usually to a lesser degree.<br/>
2.  Place the infected meat in a clean cage with the rat until it has been 
devoured.  Then, return the rat to its regular cage and provide rat chow.<br/>
3.  Some rats which have been given an unusually high dose of larvae, may 
bleed from the anus and may die.<br/>
4.  Sacrifice a few rats after 5 days and place the upper third of the 
small intestine in mammalian Ringer's solution.<br/>
5.  Slit open the small intestine and scrape the lining with the edge of a 
scalpel or razor blade to free the adults burrowed into the mucosa.<br/>
6.  Collect the adults and free them of intestinal debris by washing them 
with fresh Ringer's solution. Determine the ratio of females to male worms.<br/>
7.  Mount a male and female on a glass slide using the 10% 
glycerine-glycerine jelly technique as described in various parasitology lab 
manuals.<br/>
8.  Sacrifice a few other rats after 8-10 days and examine the blood drawn 
from the hepatic portal vein, the lungs, liver and muscle for larvae.  
Stain the blood with the Giemsa stain technique and examine the tissues for 
larvae by pressing a piece of tissue between two glass slides and examining it 
at 30X with a dissecting microscope.<br/>
9.  Sacrifice a few rats at 15 days and a few more at 35 days.  
Examine the skeletal muscles for the presence of larvae, pressing some tissue 
between two glass slides.<br/>
10.  Fix and embed in paraffin in preparation for microtomy.<br/>
10.  Make prepared slides of skeletal muscle using the Hematoxylin-Eosin 
Technique.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="left">  <i>  Trichinella spiralis</i> infection occur as the 
result of the ingestion of infected meat.  The larvae are freed from the 
meat during the host's digestion and soon enter the mucosa of the small 
intestine where further development and copulation of the adults occurs. The 
female delivers live (ovoviviparous) larvae to the mucosa over the course of 4 
to 16 weeks.  As the larvae are delivered they make their way via the 
hepatic-portal vein to the venous return, appearing in the lungs and numerous 
other tissues.  The larvae eventually take up residence in the skeletal 
muscles, most notably those of highest activity such as the muscles of 
breathing, diaphragm, intercostals, masticatory muscles, and the muscles of the 
eyes and tongue.</p>
