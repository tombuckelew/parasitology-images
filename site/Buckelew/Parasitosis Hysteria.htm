<h1 style="text-align: center;">Parasitosis Hysteria</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One day in 2023, I got an interesting query in my Facebook messages. A (real) friend (not FB friend) asked me a parasitology question. Her daughter-in-law was absolutely convinced she was infested with parasitic worms. That immediately sparked my interest and I questioned her further. Then, she asked me if I'd email her and discuss her problem, perhaps, examining some "samples". I said sure but mentioned that I didn't think the postal service would think to highly of sending stool samples through the mail. The woman had been to Walter Reed Hospital as well as Johns Hopkins but in both cases dismissed her as parasite-free. That alone should have started alarm bells ringing. However, she had lived in Africa, the Caribbean, Korea and southeast Asia for periods, and all of those places are much more parasite-ridden than life in the U.S. ...so I was excited. She told me she passed worms EVERYDAY. DING...DING...DING! Then, she mentioned that worms were emerging from her skin. BONG...BONG...BONG! But, I agreed to look. (Chris always described as the eternal optimist...a guy who could spend an afternoon digging through a barnyard of manure...expecting to find a pony).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">In a couple of days, the door bell rings and there's a stranger standing outside with a cooler. It was her husband and he drove the samples up from Baltimore. (Talk about love.) Anyway, a former student who worked as a medical technologist in a local lab had gifted me a used microscope because they were buying all new ones. The microscope was as good as or better than the scopes we used at the college. It was a medical school quality scope. So, I was excited to test my old skills at identifying the eggs of various worms. (You rarely see the worms...just the eggs they produce which how diagnosticians identify which parasites a person is infected with.) So, I got a box of slides I brought with me when I retired, some saline from Walmart and a box of latex gloves I used when I was staining furniture. I was excited, thinking my skills might be better than those at the prestigious hospitals in the DC area who seldom are asked to identify tropical diseases. When I opened the cooler, there were more than 50 samples. The alarm bells were giving me tinnitus. How did she accumulate so many samples in just the three days since we "talked". Anyway, neither skeptical nor optimistic, I began examining each sample. The first was a urine sample which might show a flagellated protozoan, Trichomonas vivax which is very common. The trouble with a day old sample is that the parasites die readily and though I thought I saw some suspicious cells, I couldn't be sure...and told her so. But even that vague comment got her excited.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I began examining the stool samples, all 20 of them...and I didn't find a thing...perhaps some undigested starch granules, some plant cells and a few yeast cells...but no parasite eggs. Then, I began looking at the samples, she was convinced were worms. They looked like small bits of liver, finely chopped...but certainly not worms. (Don't know where those "samples" came from...but not her gut!) Finally, I felt defeated, not finding anything of consequence. Later that evening, I was perusing the internet looking for photos of the eggs other than the ones I became so familiar with, quite a few years ago. I didn't see anything unfamiliar. But, then, in a related article, I came across a paper describing a psychological condition called parasitosis hysteria. It is a condition in which the patient is absolutely convinced that they're infested with parasites. It described her to a T. And, did I mention that her daughter and husband had the same condition? The article went on to say that others in the family "catch" the malady from the primary "patient". Later that day, my sister-in-law, Jenny who is psychiatric nurse visited. I told her the story and she responded, "lots of my patients have the condition... some spend the entire day scratching their skin, expected worms to emerge".</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">So, I called my friend about her daughter, told her to read up on parasitosis hysteria and then approach her daughter-in-law. She mentioned that she had a friend who is a psychiatrist and asked for advice before approaching her daughter who was in a delicate mental state. I haven't heard anything since.</p>
