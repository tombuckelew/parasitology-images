7 days post-infection of <i>Eimeria tenella</i> showing recently-fertilized macrogametocytes (now immature 
occysts) in vacuolated areas with prominent nuclei. 1000x<img border="0" height="512" src="images/Eimeria tenella 7 days.jpg" width="640"/>7  
7 days post-infection with <i>E. tenella</i> showing a young oocyst, just below an older oocyst with 
formed cyst wall (irregular body due to dehydration in the slide preparation) and 
a microgametocyte (with peripheral granules/microgametes) to its right.  
The oocysts pass out in the feces where they litter the ground and are 
infectious to other birds after a day of sporulation.  It is highly 
contagious and poultry are routinely fed with drug-spiked food to prevent 
epidemics.  The drugs are referred to as coccidiostats. 1000x</p>
