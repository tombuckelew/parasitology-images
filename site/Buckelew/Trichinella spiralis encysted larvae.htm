 larvae of<i> Trichinella spiralis </i>in nurse cells within striated 
muscle.  <i>Trichinella</i> is often referred to as the largest 
intracellular parasite.  As a larva enters a muscle cell, the cell is 
molecularly programmed to differentiate into a nurse cell which loses its 
contractile capabilities and serves to nourish the larva.   All stages of this worm's life cycle occur in a single 
host.  100x</p>
