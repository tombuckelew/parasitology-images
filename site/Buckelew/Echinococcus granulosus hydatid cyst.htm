view of a section through a hydatid cyst of<i> Echinococcus granulosus</i>.  This is an endogenous cyst 
because the daughter cysts (the encircled body) "bud" into the center of the 
fluid-filled 
cyst.  This is a very small portion of the cyst which may become quite 
large.  The host tissue can be seen at the bottom of the image.  Each 
of the smaller bodies in the enclosed circle are scolices and will develop into 
diminutive tapeworms should this be eaten by a definitive or final host such as 
a canine.  100x<br/>
