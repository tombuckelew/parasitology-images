<p>The genus <i>Paragonimus</i> has undergone considerable taxonomic splitting 
over the past 40 years.  <i>Paragonimus westermani</i> is the most common 
and widely distributed of the species.  Members of the genus are all lung 
flukes.  The egg capsules make their egress from the body through sputum or 
feces.  If the eggs are deposited in freshwater, after 16 days to several 
weeks of embryonation, the miracidia emerge seeking a snail of the family 
Thieridae, such as <i>Semisulcospira libertina</i>.  Once the miracidium 
has penetrated the snail, it sheds its ciliated epidermis and transforms into a 
sporocyst.  The sporocyst in turn gives rise to rediae which produce 
numerous cercariae.  The microcercous cercariae are characterized by their 
tail which is reduced to a small button at the posterior end.  The 
cercariae "inch" over wet rocks where they encounter and actively penetrate 11 
or more species of crabs.  The cercariae encyst in the crustacean's flesh 
as metacercariae.  A wide range of carnivores serve as definitive or final 
hosts.  Humans may also be infected when they eat raw or poorly cooked 
crabs.  In Southeast Asia, a delicacy is known as "drunken crab".  
Crabs are marinated overnight in wine which coagulates the protein and adds 
flavor.  Still, the metacercariae are unharmed and lead to infections.  
When metacercariae are ingested, they excyst in the duodenum, eventually making 
their way through the wall of the intestine, diaphragm and lung pleural to the 
spaces of the lungs.</p>
