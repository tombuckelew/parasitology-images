<title>I earned both  my Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees

<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">I earned both  
my Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees at the University of South 
Carolina in the late 1960s.  My advisor was Felix H. Lauter, a graduate of 
Louisiana State University who worked under the legendary Asa Chandler.  Lauter, 
was awarded a governmental grant of some size to educate pre-school age children 
in the low country (southeastern tip of South Carolina) of  the dangers of 
becoming infected with intestinal worms.  At the time of his grant, preliminary 
studies revealed that in the southern counties of South Carolina, rural pre-schoolers 
were infected with <i>Ascaris</i> and/or <i>Trichuris</i> at the incredible 
incidence of 73%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">    </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">I was finishing my degree and was not involved with the grant 
work but many of my classmates were.  They related sad stories of how the kids 
would question whether they had worms too.  The kids thought that being 
parasitized was normal, since they routinely passed ascarids with their daily 
stool.  (My classmates routinely took periodic doses of piperazine citrate as a 
prophylaxis since they daily handled contaminated feces).  The grant pursued a 
novel approach to education of these children, most of whom could not read given 
their age.  Lauter and his students designed a comic book entitled Carrie 
Ascaris with a storyline that depicted a cartoon, dragon-like worm that was 
portrayed as evil and caused sickness.  During this period of time, a unrelated 
incident occurred that is worth repeating.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">    </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Though these intestinal worms proved 
common amongst children in the low country, they were also common amongst all 
segments of the population in the southeastern US.  The janitor on our floor 
knocked on my office door one day and asked me if he could ask me a question.  
He presented me with a Coke bottle which had a 10 <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> 
in it.  After I told him what it was, I asked him where he obtained it.  He 
replied, I woke up this morning with it in my mouth.  <i>Ascaris,</i> which 
normally inhabits the small intestine, will migrate through digestive tract 
sphincters during heavy worm burdens.  Some emerge from the anus.  Some may even 
pass up the common bile duct to the liver.  And..some will pass through the 
pyloric sphincter into the stomach, through the cardiac sphincter into the 
esophagus and ultimately end up in the mouth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">    </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">That was not the only case of 
this nature that occurred while I was at the university.  A colleague related 
the following episode to me.  At a pre-school in a suburb of Columbia, a teacher 
was supervising kids coloring.  She noticed that no one was paying attention to 
what she was saying but instead staring at a child sitting near her.  She was 
horrified to see that this child had an ascarid sticking out of his nose.  When 
he pulled that worm out, another soon appeared and then another.  The other 
children were horrified because they thought he was pulling out his insides.  
The psychological and emotional distress in parasitized children can not be 
underestimated.</span></p>
