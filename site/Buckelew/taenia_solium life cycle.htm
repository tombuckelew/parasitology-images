<p><i>Taenia solium</i> is commonly referred to as the pork tapeworm.  
Humans harbor the adult worm and pigs serve as the intermediate host.  Egg 
capsules from human stools contaminate vegetation which pigs may eat. The egg 
capsules contain an oncosphere or hexacanth larva which when ingested by pigs, 
develops into a cysticercus, otherwise known as a bladderworm, usually in the 
muscles of the pig.  If pork is eaten poorly cooked, the cysticercus 
evaginates its scolex in the duodenum and grows into an adult up to ten meters 
long.  Pigs cooked by amateur barbecuers may serve as a source of 
infection. If humans accidentally ingest the egg capsules, cysticerci or 
bladderworms will develop in a variety of vital organs including the the brain, 
eye, heart, lungs and liver, interrupting function.  This condition is 
known as cysticercosis, causing this worm to be the most dangerous of the human 
tapeworms.  A single person who is infected may contaminate his/her 
surroundings posing a danger to others.  Infected farm workers defecating 
in the field may contaminate a crop which then may serve as a source of 
infection for humans as well as pigs.  Contaminated maids and cooks may 
inadvertently infect members of the household they serve.  </p>
