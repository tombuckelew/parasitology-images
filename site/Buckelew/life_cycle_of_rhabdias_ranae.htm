<p align="center">The Life Cycle of <i>Rhabdias ranae, </i>An Evolutionary Link 
Between Free-Living and Parasitic Nematodes</p>
<p align="left">    <i>Rhabdias ranae </i>is a nematode of <i>
Rana pipiens</i>  which incorporates a free-living phase as well as a 
parasitic phase, both exemplified by separate adults.  The parasitic phase 
is a protandrous hermaphrodite which begins as a male and later transforms into 
a female, using stored sperm from its initial sexual existence to fertilize eggs 
from its later sexual form. The resultant egg capsules produced by fertilization 
are delivered by the now-female in the lungs, coughed up and swallowed.  
The egg capsules hatch in the intestine and result in rhabditiform larvae.  
Defecation delivers the larvae to the outside where they undergo four molts, 
developing into free-living adult males and females.  After copulation, the 
free-living females produce egg capsules (fertilized eggs), a few of which hatch 
within the female, consuming the tissues of their mother.  These larvae 
emerge as filariforms and which penetrate the skin of suitable hosts such as 
frogs.  The larvae make their way to the lungs where they develop into the 
protandrous hermaphroditic adults.  This life cycle demonstrates the 
relationship and possible evolution of parasitic nematodes from free-living ones 
suggesting there may have been transitional stages between free living and 
parasitic existences.</p>
<p align="left">PROCEDURE</p>
<p align="left">1.  Sacrifice a number of <i>Rana pipiens</i> and excise 
the lungs.  Tease the lungs apart in saline and examine the parasitic 
females (protrandrous hermaphrodites).  Also, excise the rectum and examine 
it for egg capsules and rhabditiform larvae.<br/>
2.  The adults can be fixed and mounted using the glycerine mounting 
technique.<br/>
3. Scrape the lining of the rectum of infected frogs to obtain large numbers of 
egg capsules and place the scrapings in a depression slide or Syracuse dish and 
cover with some filtered aquarium or pond water.<br/>
4. Cover the dish and examine it 5-7 days later.  Replace water as it 
evaporates, keeping the specimen moist.<br/>
5.  Observe the free-living adults relative to morphology and copulation.<br/>
6.  Mount the free-living adults using the glycerine technique and compare 
the free-living adults to parasitic adult.</p>
