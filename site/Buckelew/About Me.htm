<p align="left">    I chose to create this website as a 
consequence of recurring conversations I have had with colleagues the past few 
years.  I began my career at California (then State College) University in 
1969 and have now taught during five decades. Most of my colleagues retired 
before me, and I anticipated my own retirement with some trepidation. I've now 
been retired for over 10 years. I remember that that my retired colleagues 
lamented about all the "stuff" they knew and how it would be wasted when they 
retired.  In my case, the answer has been to provide my family and friends with 
twenty minute lectures to questions easily answered with a terse yes or no, and 
to design and maintain this website, providing information to students world-wide; 
information that would otherwise eventually be deleted from my neural hard-drive.  </p>
<p align="left">    I am from Allentown, Pennsylvania and 
graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Muhlenberg College in 1965.  I 
continued my education at the University of South Carolina where I had the 
opportunity to be advised by Felix H. Lauter, who obtained his Ph. D. at 
Louisiana State University and worked under the tutelage of the legendary 
parasitologist, Asa 
Chandler.  I obtained my Master of Science in 1967 and Ph. D. in 1971 
there, working with the miracidium of <i>Megalodiscus temperatus, </i>a rectal 
fluke of frogs.  I once joked back then with a friend that my research was 
30 years ahead of its time, drawing guffaws.  It turns out that was an 
understatement, in that my research was so obscure that the scientific community 
still hasn't paid attention to it.  </p>
<p align="left">    In addition to Parasitology, I also taught 
Human Physiology and the Biology of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.  The STD 
course was taught to non-majors and could easily be named Everything You Didn't 
Want to Know about Sex (apologies to Woody Allen) but I was sure the university 
administration would have demanded a committee appearance to explain my rationale for 
such a re-naming.  </p>
<p align="left">        I have advised more 
than 20 graduate students, working on studies of parasitic protozoan 
ultrastructure, anesthesia parameters, and ultrastructural effects of anabolic 
steroids.  Most of these advisees have attained the Ph. D. or advanced medical 
degrees.  I was self-trained as an electron microscopist in the late 1960s 
and a colleague and I were awarded a Pennsylvania Distinguished Teaching Chair 
in  1979 for an EM techniques course we designed and taught during the 
1970s.  I have presented or published more than 30 scientific articles. In 
1979, I co-authored a chapter in the Chemical Rubber Company Handbook of 
Microbiology on the ultrastructure of fungi.  </p>
<p align="left">    My wife and I have restored a 25 room 
Georgian revival house and maintain an antique shop, dealing in 18th and 19th 
century American furniture and accessories, English china from 
1750-1850, and vintage Persian, Turkish, and Baluchistan rugs from our shop, 
Beeson Hill Antiques.  I have done as many as a dozen antique shows per year, 
and I actively sold antique and rare books on Ebay.  I have made over 150 pieces 
of furniture of my own design, patterned after 18th and 19th century American 
furniture.</p>
<p align="left">        In designing this 
website, I have tried to embody it with a sample of my fun-loving personality, 
coupled with a disciplined approach to academics.  My attitude with higher 
education is to convince students that learning should not be approached as a 
chore but welcomed not only as an avenue to a better life but as an enjoyable 
experience.  I encourage camaraderie amongst the students yet  friendly 
rivalry.  Asa Chandler once stated in his Introduction to Parasitology, 
published in 1930, that "parasitology touches upon or overlaps so many other 
sciences that a parasitologist probably has to stick his nose into more 
different fields of knowledge than any other kind of biologist  A 
parasitologist, like an orchid, requires long and careful nurturing, and 
develops slowly.  But when he/she comes to flower he/she is a rare and 
beautiful object, scientifically speaking, and is usually slow in going to 
seed".  </p>
