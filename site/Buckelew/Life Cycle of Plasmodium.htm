<p>Life Cycle of<i> Plasmodium</i> spp.</p>
<img border="0" height="959" src="images/Ultrastructure/Plasmodium drawing.jpg" width="780"/>
</center><br/>
<i>Plasmodium </i>spp uses a vertebrate host in which asexual reproduction takes 
place and in an invertebrate host (mosquito)  where sexual reproduction 
takes place.  Since the definitive host is defined as the host in which 
sexual reproduction takes place, the mosquito technically is the definitive 
host.  The life cycle as depicted here, begins with the female mosquito (<i>Anopheles</i> 
spp), biting the human host and injecting sporozoites with its saliva.  The 
sporozoites travel to the liver where they penetrate hepatic cells and undergo a 
rapid division called schizogeny  often referred to as the exoerythocytic 
phase or simply liver phase.  The resulting schizonts are known as 
cryptozoites.  The resulting thousands of  merozoites emerge from the 
liver cell and enter the bloodstream, penetrating erythrocytes and beginning the 
erythrocytic phase of the life cycle. Some remain in the liver and become 
hypnozoites, resulting in later relapses in the case of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> 
and <i>P. ovale</i> in humans. Once in RBCs, the merozoites are now referred to 
as trophozoites which ingests RBC cytoplasm and forms a vacuole which gives the 
trophozoite the appearance of a ring (ring stage).  The trophozoite almost 
immediately begins to divide producing another schizogonic phase.  As the 
schizont doles out cytoplasm to the dividing nuclei, it is known as a segmenter, 
and when the divisions are complete, individual cells are known as merozoites.  
Merozoites emerge in a periodic fashion depending upon the species, and cause 
the classic chills and fever associated with malaria.  Plasmodium <i>vivax</i> 
and <i>P. ovale</i> demonstrate a 48 hour cycle, while <i>P. malariae</i> 
infections reveal a 72 hour cycle.  <i>P. falciparum</i> periodicity is 
also a 48 hour cycle but the regularity of the cycle is not as rigid as in <i>P. 
vivax</i> or<i> P</i>. <i>ovale</i>.  Emerging merozoites will infect other 
RBCs and repeat the cycle but some develop into macro- and microgametocytes 
leading to the sexual cycle in the mosquito.  If a susceptible mosquito 
ingests gametocytes, the gametocytes will develop into macro-and microgametes (microgametes 
exflagellate as seen in the diagram), which will in turn fuse in the act of 
sexual union in the midgut of the mosquito.  The resulting zygote becomes 
motile and penetrates the lining of the mosquito gut, ending up encysted on the 
outside wall, bathed in the hemolymph of the hemocoel.  At this point this 
encysted form is known as an oocyst.  Meiosis occurs and the resulting 
sporoblasts repeatedly divide forming 1000s of haploid sporozoites.  The 
sporozoites migrate through the hemocoel, entering the salivary glands where 
they remain throughout the life of the mosquito, infecting new hosts with each 
blood meal.  Contaminated blood passed during transfusions, needle-sharing 
amongst drug addicts, accidental needle sticks in hospital and laboratory 
workers, and rarely, transplacental passages of blood phases also can lead to 
infections.
