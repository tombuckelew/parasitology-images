This is a  frontal view drawing by the author of this website, made after 
four years of study of this miracidium of <i>Megalodiscus temperatus</i>. This 
larva has a series of epidermal plates which are arranged in rows of 6, 8, 4, 
and 2 from top to bottom.  Upon attachment to its snail host, the epidermal 
plates detach and, with the cilia still beating, swim away, leaving the 
remaining miracidium to enter the snail.  It is literally a bag of 
digestive enzymes, contained within the four penetration glands, apical gland, 
secretory sac, and two accessory penetration glands.  1000x</p>
