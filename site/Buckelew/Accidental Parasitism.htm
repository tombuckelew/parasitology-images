<title>In 1974</title>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In 1974, my 
first graduate student telephoned me late one night.  He exclaimed that I was 
really going to proud of him, since he just passed two rather large worms.  
While assuring him that pride was probably not the best attribute to describe 
being parasitized, I questioned him about his companions.  While he was 
answering, I was thinking about any high risk group he might belong to and none 
came to mind.  He told me that one worm was about 10 long and the other about 
6 long.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">    </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">As an undergraduate of California, I knew he had a rigorous 
invertebrate zoology course and should be aware of  the common parasitic worms 
of humans.  I asked him if it was a tapeworm or an ascarid which seemed the only 
possibilities given the size of the worms.  He answered that it was neither a 
tape nor an ascarid, because its peculiar gross morphology didnt fit either of 
those two categories. I began to think of any other possibility that would 
explain the presence of these worms passed in feces.  I then asked him (almost 
jokingly) if he been eating any insects lately.  There was a long pause after 
which he told me the following.  One night about a month before, he went for a 
walk in a forest near his house.  The sky was cloudless and he was lost in 
thought admiring the stars.  At that point, an insect, (presumably a beetle) 
flew into his mouth.  It lodged so far down in this throat, that despite 
numerous attempts to cough it out, he generated an excess of saliva and 
swallowed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">    </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">While he was relating this to me, I was reading up on a worm, that 
normally infects pigs but has infected humans on extremely rare occasions.  The 
worm is <i>Macracanthorhyncus hirudinaceous</i> otherwise known as the 
spiny-headed worm of pigs.  This worm utilizes beetles as intermediate hosts, 
with pigs usually becoming infected by eating grubs they encounter while rooting 
in the soil.  The pre-patent period (time between infection and development of 
adulthood) for the worm is 32 days (which nicely dovetails with his recollection 
of swallowing the beetle about a month before).   I became excited at the 
prospect of this case of accidental parasitism and suggested he bring the worms 
in the next day and wed examined them together.  He mentioned that he had been 
experiencing a prolonged case of diarrhea and had a doctors appointment that 
evening.  I admonished him not to let the physician have the worms since 
physicians in those days had a relatively modest education in parasitism and few 
physicians would have even heard of this particular worm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">   The next day when we 
met, he apologized that the worm was gone.  His physician took the worm into his 
adjoining laboratory for examination.  After a few minutes, he heard the toilet 
flush.  The physician told my student it was just some undigested cabbage and 
suggested he chew his halupkies (a local ethnic delight) a little better.  
Nevertheless, if he truly were parasitized in this crazy turn of events, he 
likely would still show the presence of egg capsules from this worm in his stool 
.  I suggested he collect a stool sample and not surprisingly, using the 
zinc-sulfate floatation technique,  egg capsules of this worm were identified in 
his sample, validating my guess and providing me with a story, I relish 
re-telling and my students enjoy hearing.</span></p>
