<i>Trypanosoma ranarum</i> from <i>Rana pipiens.  </i>This photograph was 
taken from cultured organisms which are in the initial stages of division.  
This is the epimastigote form with the section cut at midbody at the level of 
the nucleus (NC).  The chondriome (MI) can be seen to the lower left, 
dictyosome (DI) aside the nucleus, and ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum (RER).  
A basal body (B) can be seen near the top of the photo.  The subpellicular 
microtubules are only distinct near the top. No undulating membrane can been 
seen because this section has occurred at a level below its emergence from the cell.
