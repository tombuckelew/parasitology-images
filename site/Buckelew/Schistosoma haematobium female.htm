This is midbody of a female <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i>.  The large ovoid body to the right is the ovary 
which releases its eggs through an oviduct which extends upwards in this photo, 
then passes anteriorly (to the left) where it enters the ootype, seen here as a 
dark red body to the left of the ovary.  The tube leading from the ootype 
is the uterus. Vitelline granule can be seen to the upper right.  100x</p>
